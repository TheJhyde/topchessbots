Top Chess Bots is a python script to run two bots that play with [@topchessgames](https://twitter.com/topchessgames) on twitter. They use stockfish to generate smart chess moves. You can see them in action at [@chess_bot_alpha](https://twitter.com/chess_bot_alpha) and [@chess_bot_omega](https://twitter.com/chess_bot_omega).

If you wanted to make your own version of this, you'll need to install [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) and download the [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy), [tracery](https://github.com/aparrish/pytracery), and [python-chess](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-chess) libraries. Running the script will post once - I used [launchd](http://www.launchd.info/) for scheduling and I've included the property list to have it run once an hour.
